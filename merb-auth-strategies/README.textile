merb-auth-strategies
==========

A collection of strategies for use in the merb-auth framework.  

To setup these strategies you should just use the constant to activate them in the order you'd like to use them.

For example, in your init.rb file, to use basic_auth then form based authentication you'd have something like:

Authentication::Strategies::Password::BasicAuth
Authentication::Strategies::Password::Form

This will activate the strategies in the order you used the constants.  You can mix and match
them with your own strategies too.

<pre><code>
  class MyStrategy < Authentication::Strategy
    def run!
      do_stuff
    end
  end
  
  Authentication::Strategies::Password::Form
  
  class AnotherStrategy < AuthenticationStrategy
    def run!
      do_other_stuff
    end
  end
  
</code></pre>
