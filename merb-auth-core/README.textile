MerbAuth is a very _unopinionated_ authentication framework for use with the
Merb web framework.

MerbAuth has moved to "merb-plugins":http://github.com/wycats/merb-plugins/tree/master as merb_auth

Please use that repository for the code and submit all patches / bugs / requests in the normal merb way (Lighthouse etc)
